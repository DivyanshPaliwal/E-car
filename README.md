# E-car

This project is a fully responsive E-car website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Swiper.js library. The website aims to showcase different car models, their specifications, and allow users to browse through them using a carousel/slider powered by Swiper.js.

## Technologies used

The following technologies are utilized in this project:

* HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the website, define the layout, and create the different web page elements.

* CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed to apply styles and visual enhancements to the website, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design.

* JavaScript: JavaScript is utilized to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It enables functionality such as image sliders, navigation menus, form validation, and other client-side interactions.

* Swiper.js: Swiper.js is a powerful JavaScript library used to create responsive and touch-enabled carousels, sliders, and image galleries. It enhances the user experience by providing smooth transitions and swipe gestures for navigating through car models.
